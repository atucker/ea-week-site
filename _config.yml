      Professor Acemoglu will discuss why it has been difficult throughout history to build state capacity, and why the development of the notion of generalized rights has been instrumental in the emergence of states that have the capacity to deliver services, but are constrained in their ability to dominate society. <br />
      Daron Acemoglu is the Killian Professor of Economics at MIT. In 2005 he received the John Bates Clark Medal awarded to economists under forty judged to have made the most significant contribution to economic thought and knowledge.<br />
      This event is open to the public.<br />
